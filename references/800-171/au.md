# NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 — 03.03 Audit and Accountability

The Audit and Accountability family provides security requirements for creating, protecting, and retaining system audit records to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unauthorized activity.

**Source:** Derived from SP 800-53 Rev 5 Audit and Accountability (AU) family.

## 03.03.01 Event Logging

Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unauthorized system activity.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-2, AU-3, AU-3(1), AU-12

**Discussion:** Auditable events include password changes, failed logon attempts, access to CUI, privilege escalation, administrative actions, and other security-relevant events. Audit records include timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/subject identities, event descriptions, and outcomes.

---

## 03.03.02 Audit Record Content

Ensure that audit records contain sufficient information to establish what type of event occurred, when and where the event occurred, the source of the event, and the outcome of the event.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-3, AU-3(1)

**Discussion:** Audit record content includes timestamps, user identities, event types, event outcomes (success/failure), source and destination network addresses, and objects or resources accessed.

---

## 03.03.03 Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting

Review and analyze system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity. Report findings to designated organizational officials.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-6, AU-6(3)

**Discussion:** Organizations define what constitutes inappropriate or unusual activity. Audit review and analysis is supported by automated mechanisms that can correlate audit records across repositories and centralize audit review. Findings are reported to personnel with incident response responsibilities.

---

## 03.03.04 Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation

Provide an audit record reduction and report generation capability that supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-7

**Discussion:** Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log information and organizes it to support timely analysis. Report generation provides the ability to produce audit reports on demand for incident response and organizational decision-making.

---

## 03.03.05 Time Stamps

Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records and synchronize internal system clocks with an authoritative time source.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-8

**Discussion:** Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or as local time with an offset from UTC. Synchronization with an authoritative time source (e.g., NTP servers) ensures time stamps are consistent across systems for correlation of audit records.

---

## 03.03.06 Protection of Audit Information

Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-9, AU-9(4)

**Discussion:** Audit information includes all audit records, audit settings, and audit reports. Organizations protect audit information by restricting access to audit logs, using encryption, and storing audit information on separate systems or media. Access to management of audit logging functionality is limited to a subset of privileged users.

---

## 03.03.07 Audit Record Retention

Retain audit records for an organization-defined time period to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-11

**Discussion:** Organizations retain audit records for the time period consistent with records retention policies to support after-the-fact investigations and regulatory compliance. Retention periods are influenced by legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.

---

## 03.03.08 Audit Record Generation

Provide audit record generation capability for the events defined in the event logging requirement across all system components. Allow designated organizational personnel to select the auditable events that are to be logged by specific components.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** AU-12

**Discussion:** Audit record generation occurs at each processing, storage, or transmission point to capture information before it could be altered. Organizations define auditable events appropriate for the system and mission requirements.
