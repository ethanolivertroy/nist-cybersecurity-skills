# NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 — 03.15 Security Assessment and Monitoring

The Security Assessment and Monitoring family provides security requirements for assessing, monitoring, and correcting deficiencies in security controls for systems processing CUI.

**Source:** Derived from SP 800-53 Rev 5 Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring (CA) family.

## 03.15.01 System Security Plan

Develop, document, and maintain a system security plan that describes system boundaries, the operating environment, security requirements implementation, and relationships with or connections to other systems.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** CA-2, PL-2

**Discussion:** Organizations develop system security plans that provide an overview of the security requirements and describe the controls in place or planned. For nonfederal systems handling CUI, the SSP documents how 800-171 requirements are met.

## 03.15.02 Security Assessments

Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application. Develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** CA-2, CA-5, CA-7

**Discussion:** Organizations assess security controls through testing, evaluation, and review. Plans of action document identified weaknesses and track remediation progress. Ongoing monitoring provides awareness of control effectiveness and changes to systems and environments.

## 03.15.03 Internal System Connections

Authorize internal connections of system components and monitor the connections.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** CA-9

**Discussion:** Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and separate constituent components. Organizations identify and authorize connections and continuously monitor the connections to detect anomalous behavior.
