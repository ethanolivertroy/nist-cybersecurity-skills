## 03.06.01 Incident Handling

Establish an operational incident handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery activities. Coordinate incident handling activities with contingency planning activities.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** IR-4, IR-4(1)

**Discussion:** Organizations establish incident handling capabilities that are consistent with the incident response plan. Incident handling includes forensic analysis, evidence collection, coordination with external parties, and automated incident handling processes. Lessons learned from incidents are incorporated into procedures and training.

## 03.06.02 Incident Monitoring and Reporting

Track, document, and report incidents to designated organizational officials and external authorities.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** IR-5, IR-6, IR-6(1)

**Discussion:** Organizations track incidents from initial detection through resolution, documenting incident details, status, and resolution. Incident information is reported to organizational incident response personnel, legal counsel, and external organizations (e.g., contracting agencies, law enforcement) as required.

## 03.06.03 Incident Response Testing

Test the incident response capability periodically.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** IR-3, IR-3(2)

**Discussion:** Organizations test incident response capabilities using tabletop exercises, simulations, or full-scale exercises. Testing validates the effectiveness of the incident response plan, procedures, and personnel readiness. Results are used to improve the incident response capability.
