## 03.11.01 System Security Plan

Develop a system security plan for organizational systems. Define the authorization boundary of the system. Describe the operational context of the system in terms of mission and business processes. Describe the system stakeholders, security requirements, and implementation of each requirement, including a basis for any tailoring or alternative implementations. Review and update the system security plan periodically.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PL-2

**Discussion:** System security plans describe the implementation of security requirements for systems. The plan provides a description of the system architecture, the placement and configuration of security controls, and the interrelationships between the system and other systems. For 800-171 implementations, the SSP documents how each requirement is met.

## 03.11.02 Rules of Behavior

Establish and provide rules that describe the responsibilities and expected behavior of individuals with access to the system. Receive a signed acknowledgment from such individuals indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior before authorizing access.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PL-4

**Discussion:** Rules of behavior represent a description of what is expected of personnel with respect to system use. Rules include responsibilities regarding CUI handling, acceptable use of organizational resources, internet usage, social media, and consequences of noncompliance. Rules may be part of acceptable use policies.

## 03.11.03 Security Concept of Operations

Develop a security concept of operations for organizational systems, if deemed necessary by the organization.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PL-7

**Discussion:** The security concept of operations describes how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security. It includes a description of the security environment, threats, trust assumptions, and defensive strategy. The concept of operations supports the system security plan.
