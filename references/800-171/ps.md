When individuals are terminated or transferred, protect CUI by terminating system access and retrieving all CUI-related organizational system-related property in a timely manner. Conduct exit interviews. Revoke authentication credentials. Retain access to organizational information and systems formerly controlled by the terminated individual.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PS-4, PS-5

**Discussion:** Organizations disable access promptly upon termination and review access authorizations upon transfer. System-related property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration/security manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews include reminders about CUI handling obligations.
