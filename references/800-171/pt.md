## 03.17.01 Authority to Process PII

Determine and document the legal authority that permits the processing of personally identifiable information.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PT-2

**Discussion:** Organizations identify the legal bases for processing PII, which may include federal laws, executive orders, regulations, contracts, or consent. Documentation supports accountability and transparency in PII processing.

## 03.17.02 PII Processing Purposes

Identify and document the purpose(s) for processing personally identifiable information.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PT-3

**Discussion:** Organizations document the purposes for collecting and processing PII and limit processing to only those purposes that are authorized and documented. Purpose specification supports the principle of purpose limitation and prevents scope creep in PII use.

## 03.17.03 Consent

Implement mechanisms to obtain consent from individuals for the processing of their PII prior to its collection when required.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PT-4

**Discussion:** Organizations obtain and document consent for PII processing where required by law, regulation, or policy. Consent mechanisms are clear, specific, and allow individuals to understand what they are consenting to. Consent may be obtained through privacy notices, agreements, or other mechanisms.

## 03.17.04 Privacy Notice

Provide effective notice to individuals regarding the processing of their PII.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** PT-5
