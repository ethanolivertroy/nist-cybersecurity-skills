# NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 — 03.16 Supply Chain Risk Management

The Supply Chain Risk Management family provides security requirements for managing supply chain risks to systems and system components used to process, store, or transmit CUI.

**Source:** Derived from SP 800-53 Rev 5 Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) family. New in SP 800-171 Rev 3.

## 03.16.05 Supply Chain Risk Management Plan

Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and system services.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** SR-2

**Discussion:** Organizations develop supply chain risk management plans that address threats and vulnerabilities in the supply chain, methods and processes for assessing and mitigating supply chain risks, and roles and responsibilities. Plans are reviewed and updated periodically.

---

## 03.16.06 Acquisition Strategies and Tools

Employ acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** SR-5

**Discussion:** Organizations use acquisition strategies and contract tools to manage supply chain risks, including requirements for provenance, component authenticity, and tamper protection. Contract clauses address security requirements for suppliers and flow-down to subcontractors.

---

## 03.16.07 Supplier Assessments and Reviews

Assess and review the supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service they provide.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** SR-6

**Discussion:** Organizations conduct periodic assessments of suppliers and contractors to evaluate supply chain risks. Assessments include reviewing supplier security practices, evaluating component sources, and monitoring supplier security posture.

---

## 03.16.08 Component Authenticity

Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policies and procedures. Detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the system.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** SR-11

**Discussion:** Organizations implement anti-counterfeit measures to protect against the introduction of counterfeit hardware, software, and firmware components. Measures include provenance verification, tamper detection, and inspection of components.

---

## 03.16.09 Notification Agreements

Establish agreements and procedures with entities involved in the supply chain for notification of supply chain compromises.

**Mapped SP 800-53 Controls:** SR-8

**Discussion:** Organizations establish notification agreements with suppliers and partners to ensure timely communication of supply chain compromises, vulnerabilities, and other security-relevant events.
