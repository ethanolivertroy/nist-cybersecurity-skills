## AT-6: Training Feedback

Requires the organization to provide feedback on organizational training results to designated personnel at an organization-defined frequency. This supports continuous improvement of the training program based on effectiveness metrics and participant feedback.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined.

**Related Controls:** None

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)
