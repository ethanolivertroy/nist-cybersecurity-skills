# NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 — CA: Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring

The Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring family addresses the policies and procedures for assessing security and privacy controls, authorizing system operation, and monitoring controls on an ongoing basis.

---

## CA-1: Policy and Procedures

Requires the organization to develop, document, disseminate, and periodically review and update assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures addressing purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined.

**Related Controls:** PM-9, PS-8, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

---

## CA-2: Control Assessments

Requires the organization to develop a control assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment, including controls and enhancements under assessment, assessment procedures, assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities. Assess the controls at an organization-defined frequency to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome. Produce a security and privacy assessment report and provide results to designated personnel.

**Key Enhancements:**

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| CA-2(1) | Independent Assessors |
| CA-2(2) | Specialized Assessments |
| CA-2(3) | Leveraging Results from External Organizations |

**Related Controls:** AC-20, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, RA-5, RA-10, SA-11, SC-38, SI-3, SI-12, SR-2, SR-3

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

---

## CA-3: Information Exchange

Requires the organization to approve and manage the exchange of information between the system and other systems using interconnection security agreements (ISAs), memoranda of understanding/agreement, or other exchange agreements. Document the interface characteristics, security and privacy requirements, controls, and responsibilities for each connection.

**Key Enhancements:**

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| CA-3(1) | Unclassified National Security System Connections |
| CA-3(2) | Classified National Security System Connections |
| CA-3(3) | Unclassified Non-National Security System Connections |
| CA-3(4) | Connections to Public Networks |
| CA-3(5) | Restrictions on External System Connections |
| CA-3(6) | Transfer Authorizations |
| CA-3(7) | Transitive Information Exchanges |

**Related Controls:** AC-4, AC-20, AU-16, CA-6, IA-3, IR-4, PL-2, PT-7, RA-3, SA-9, SC-7, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

## CA-4: Security Certification

*Withdrawn.* Incorporated into CA-2.

---

## CA-5: Plan of Action and Milestones

Requires the organization to develop a plan of action and milestones (POA&M) for the system to document the planned remediation actions of the organization to correct weaknesses or deficiencies identified during control assessments, and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities. Update the POA&M at an organization-defined frequency based on findings from control assessments, audits, and continuous monitoring.

**Key Enhancements:**

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| CA-5(1) | Automation Support for Accuracy and Currency |

**Related Controls:** CA-2, CA-7, PM-4, PM-9, RA-7, SI-2, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

---

## CA-6: Authorization

Requires the organization to assign a senior official (authorizing official) to authorize the system for processing before commencing operations, and to update the authorization at an organization-defined frequency. The authorizing official accepts the security and privacy risk to organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with operation of the system.

**Key Enhancements:**

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| CA-6(1) | Joint Authorization — Intra-Organization |
| CA-6(2) | Joint Authorization — Inter-Organization |

**Related Controls:** CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10, RA-3, SA-10, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

---

## CA-7: Continuous Monitoring

Requires the organization to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program that includes establishing organization-defined metrics to be monitored, monitoring control effectiveness at an organization-defined frequency, conducting ongoing assessments per the continuous monitoring strategy, correlating and analyzing information generated by assessments and monitoring, taking response actions to address results, and reporting security and privacy status to designated personnel.

**Key Enhancements:**

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| CA-7(1) | Independent Assessment |
| CA-7(3) | Trend Analyses |
| CA-7(4) | Risk Monitoring |
