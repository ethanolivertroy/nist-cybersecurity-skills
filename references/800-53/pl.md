# NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 — Planning (PL) Family

## PL-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate a planning policy and procedures that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance. Review and update the policy and procedures at organization-defined frequencies.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PL-1.

**Related Controls:** PM-9, PS-8, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

## PL-2: System Security and Privacy Plans

Develop security and privacy plans for the system that are consistent with the organization's enterprise architecture; explicitly define the constituent system components; describe the operational context of the system in terms of mission and business processes; identify the individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities; identify the information types processed, stored, and transmitted by the system; provide the applicable security categorization including supporting rationale; describe any specific threats to the system; provide the results of a privacy risk assessment; describe the operational environment and any dependencies on or connections to other systems; provide an overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system; identify any relevant control tailoring; describe the control implementation including planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs; and are reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PL-2(1):** Concept of Operations — [Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-7.]
- **PL-2(2):** Functional Architecture — [Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-8.]
- **PL-2(3):** Plan and Coordinate with Other Organizational Entities — [Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2.]

**Related Controls:** AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, CM-9, CM-13, CP-2, CP-4, IR-4, IR-8, MA-4, MA-5, MP-4, MP-5, PL-7, PL-8, PL-10, PL-11, PM-1, PM-7, PM-8, PM-9, PM-10, PM-11, RA-3, RA-8, RA-9, SA-5, SA-17, SA-22, SI-12, SR-2, SR-4

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

## PL-3: System Security Plan Update

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2.]

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

---

## PL-4: Rules of Behavior

Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior for information and system usage, security, and privacy. Receive a documented acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to information and the system. Review and update the rules of behavior at an organization-defined frequency. Require individuals who have acknowledged a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and re-acknowledge revised/updated rules.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PL-4(1):** Social Media and External Site/Application Usage Restrictions — Include in the rules of behavior restrictions on the use of social media, social networking sites, and external sites/applications as well as posting organizational information on public websites.

**Related Controls:** AC-2, AC-6, AC-8, AC-9, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AT-2, AT-3, CM-11, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MP-7, PS-6, PS-8, SA-5, SI-12

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

## PL-5: Privacy Impact Assessment

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into RA-8.]

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

---

## PL-6: Security-Related Activity Planning

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2.]

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

---

## PL-7: Concept of Operations

Develop a concept of operations for the system describing how the organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information security and privacy. Review and update the concept of operations at an organization-defined frequency.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PL-7.

**Related Controls:** PL-2, SA-2, SI-12

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

---

## PL-8: Security and Privacy Architectures

Develop security and privacy architectures for the system that describe the requirements and approach to be taken for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information; describe the requirements and approach to be taken for processing personally identifiable information to minimize privacy risk to individuals; describe how the architectures are integrated into and support the enterprise architecture; and are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency to reflect changes in the enterprise architecture.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PL-8(1):** Defense in Depth — Design the security and privacy architectures for the system using a defense-in-depth approach that applies organization-defined types of controls at organization-defined levels, allocates organization-defined controls to organization-defined locations, and allocates organization-defined controls to organization-defined architectural layers.
- **PL-8(2):** Supplier Diversity — Require that organization-defined controls allocated to organization-defined locations and architectural layers are obtained from different suppliers.

**Related Controls:** CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PL-7, PL-9, PM-5, PM-7, RA-9, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-17, SC-7

**Baselines:** Moderate, High

## PL-9: Central Management

Centrally manage organization-defined controls and related processes.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PL-9.

**Related Controls:** PL-8, PM-9

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PL-10: Baseline Selection

Select a control baseline for the system.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PL-10.

**Related Controls:** PL-2, PL-11, RA-2, RA-3, SA-8

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High

---

## PL-11: Baseline Tailoring

Tailor the selected control baseline by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning specific values to organization-defined parameters, supplementing baselines with additional controls or control enhancements, and providing additional specification information for control implementation.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PL-11.

**Related Controls:** PL-10, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-8

**Baselines:** Low, Moderate, High
