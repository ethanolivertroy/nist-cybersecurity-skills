## PT-1: Policy and Procedures

Develop, document, and disseminate a personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance. Review and update the policy and procedures at organization-defined frequencies.

**Key Enhancements:** None defined for PT-1.

**Related Controls:** None

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-2: Authority to Process Personally Identifiable Information

Determine and document the legal authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information, either generally or in support of a specific program or system need. Specify in privacy notices the authority that permits the collection, use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information. Limit the collection, use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information to only that which is legally authorized and only for the authorized purpose(s).

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-2(1):** Data Tagging — Attach data tags containing the authorized purposes and other relevant metadata to organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information.
- **PT-2(2):** Automation — Manage enforcement of the authorized purposes for which personally identifiable information is collected, used, maintained, and shared with organization-defined automated mechanisms.

**Related Controls:** AC-2, AC-3, CM-13, IR-9, PM-9, PM-24, PT-1, PT-3, PT-5, PT-6, RA-3, RA-8, SI-12, SI-18

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-3: Personally Identifiable Information Processing Purposes

Identify and document the organization-defined purpose(s) for processing personally identifiable information. Describe the purpose(s) in the public privacy notices and policies of the organization. Restrict the processing of personally identifiable information to only that which is compatible with the identified purpose(s). Monitor changes in processing personally identifiable information and implement organization-defined mechanisms to ensure that any changes are made in accordance with original purpose limitation requirements.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-3(1):** Data Tagging — Attach data tags containing organization-defined permissible processing purposes to organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information.
- **PT-3(2):** Automation — Track processing purposes of personally identifiable information using organization-defined automated mechanisms.

**Related Controls:** AC-2, AC-3, AT-3, CM-13, IR-9, PM-9, PM-25, PT-2, PT-5, PT-6, PT-7, RA-8, SC-43, SI-12, SI-18

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-4: Consent

Implement organization-defined tools or mechanisms for individuals to consent to the processing of their personally identifiable information prior to its collection that facilitate individuals' informed decision-making. Provide organization-defined mechanisms for individuals to request removal of consent that are easy to use and accessible. Implement organization-defined alternative processes for individuals unable to provide or revoke consent. Update consent records, as appropriate, at an organization-defined frequency.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-4(1):** Tailored Consent — Provide organization-defined mechanisms to allow individuals to tailor processing permissions to selected elements of personally identifiable information.
- **PT-4(2):** Just-in-Time Consent — Present organization-defined consent mechanisms to individuals at organization-defined frequency and in conjunction with organization-defined personally identifiable information processing.
- **PT-4(3):** Revocation — Implement organization-defined tools or mechanisms for individuals to revoke consent to the processing of their personally identifiable information.

**Related Controls:** AC-16, PT-2, PT-5

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-5: Privacy Notice

Provide notice to individuals about the processing of personally identifiable information that is clear and easy-to-understand, provides timely notice to individuals, and is available in the languages identified by the organization. Provide organization-defined privacy notice methods that are accessible to the intended audience. Review and update privacy notices at an organization-defined frequency and in response to changes in the processing of personally identifiable information.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-5(1):** Just-in-Time Notice — Present notice of personally identifiable information processing to individuals at a time and location where the individual provides personally identifiable information or in conjunction with a data action, or at an organization-defined frequency.
- **PT-5(2):** Privacy Act Statements — Include Privacy Act statements on forms that collect information that will be maintained in a Privacy Act system of records, or provide Privacy Act statements on separate forms that can be retained by individuals.

**Related Controls:** PM-20, PM-22, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4, PT-7, RA-3, SC-42, SI-18

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-6: System of Records Notice

Publish system of records notices in the Federal Register, subject to required oversight processes, for systems containing personally identifiable information. Keep system of records notices accurate, up-to-date, and scoped in accordance with policy.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-6(1):** Routine Uses — Review all routine uses published in the system of records notice at an organization-defined frequency to ensure continued accuracy and to ensure that routine uses continue to be compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.
- **PT-6(2):** Exemption Rules — Review all Privacy Act exemptions claimed for the system of records at an organization-defined frequency to ensure they remain appropriate and necessary in accordance with law, that they have been promulgated as combfinal rules in the Federal Register, and that they are accurately described in the system of records notice.

**Related Controls:** AC-3, PM-20, PT-2, PT-3, PT-5

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## PT-7: Specific Categories of Personally Identifiable Information

Apply organization-defined processing conditions for specific categories of personally identifiable information.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **PT-7(1):** Social Security Numbers — When it is necessary to collect social security numbers, the organization describes the purpose of collection, the authority for collection, the intended use, and whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary.
