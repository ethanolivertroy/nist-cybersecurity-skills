**Key Enhancements:**
- **SR-4(1):** Identity — Establish and maintain unique identification of organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with the identified system and critical system components.
- **SR-4(2):** Track and Trace — Establish and maintain unique identification of organization-defined supply chain elements and processes for tracking and tracing of organization-defined systems, system components, and associated data through the supply chain.
- **SR-4(3):** Validate as Genuine and Not Altered — Employ organization-defined controls to validate that the system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.
- **SR-4(4):** Supply Chain Integrity — Employ organization-defined controls and an analysis of organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and personnel associated with organization-defined systems and system components to ensure the integrity of the supply chain.

**Related Controls:** CM-8, MA-2, MA-6, RA-9, SA-3, SA-8, SI-4

**Baselines:** None (not in any baseline)

## SR-5: Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods

Employ organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks.

**Key Enhancements:**
- **SR-5(1):** Adequate Supply — Employ organization-defined controls to ensure an adequate supply of organization-defined critical system components.
- **SR-5(2):** Assessments Prior to Selection, Acceptance, Modification, or Update — Assess the system, system component, or system service prior to selection, acceptance, modification, or update.

**Related Controls:** AT-3, SA-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-9, SA-10, SA-15, SR-6, SR-9, SR-10, SR-11
