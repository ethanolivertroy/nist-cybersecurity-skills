# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — CA: Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring family evaluate whether the organization conducts security assessments, authorizes systems, and monitors controls on an ongoing basis.

---

## CA-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy; procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for assessment and authorization policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing assessment and authorization policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-01a. — An assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- CA-01b. — Assessment, authorization, and monitoring procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- CA-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## CA-2: Control Assessments

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization assesses the controls in the system and its environment of operation to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.

**Examine:** Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy; security assessment plan; security assessment report; system security plan; assessment evidence; plan of action and milestones.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for control assessments; assessors; authorizing officials.

**Test:** Assessment tools and techniques; automated assessment mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-02a.[01] — A security and privacy assessment plan is developed that describes the scope of the assessment
- CA-02a.[02] — The assessment plan describes the assessment procedures to be used
- CA-02a.[03] — The assessment plan describes the assessment environment, team, and roles
- CA-02b. — Controls are assessed at an organization-defined frequency to determine the extent to which they are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
- CA-02c. — A security and privacy assessment report is produced documenting the results of the assessment
- CA-02d. — The results of control assessments are provided to organization-defined individuals or roles

## CA-3: Information Exchange

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization authorizes and monitors information exchange between the system and other systems.

**Examine:** System interconnection agreements; memoranda of understanding; system security plans; information exchange policies; interconnection security agreements.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for managing system interconnections; authorizing officials.

**Test:** Information exchange authorization mechanisms; monitoring mechanisms for interconnections.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-03a. — Connections to other systems are approved and managed through organization-defined authorization process
- CA-03b. — Information exchange requirements are documented for each interconnection
- CA-03c. — System interconnections are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

## CA-5: Plan of Action and Milestones

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops and updates a plan of action and milestones to document planned remediation actions.

**Examine:** Plan of action and milestones; security assessment reports; risk assessment results; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for POA&M management; authorizing officials; information system security officers.

**Test:** POA&M management processes; tracking tools; remediation verification processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-05a. — A plan of action and milestones is developed for the system to document planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies found during control assessments
- CA-05b. — The plan of action and milestones is updated at an organization-defined frequency based on findings from control assessments, audits, and continuous monitoring

---

## CA-7: Continuous Monitoring

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops and implements a continuous monitoring strategy and program.

**Examine:** Continuous monitoring strategy; continuous monitoring program documentation; system security plan; security assessment reports; configuration management records; status reports.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for continuous monitoring; information system security officers; system administrators.

**Test:** Continuous monitoring tools and mechanisms; automated monitoring processes; reporting mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-07a. — A system-level continuous monitoring strategy is developed and a program is implemented that includes establishing organization-defined metrics to be monitored
- CA-07b. — Organization-defined frequencies for monitoring and assessments supporting monitoring are established
- CA-07c. — Ongoing control assessments are conducted in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy
- CA-07d. — The security and privacy status of the system is reported to organization-defined personnel at an organization-defined frequency
- CA-07e. — Organization-defined actions are taken to address results of analysis of monitoring data

---

## CA-9: Internal System Connections

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization authorizes and monitors internal connections of system components.

**Examine:** System security plan; system design documentation; internal connection authorization records; system component inventory; network diagrams.

**Interview:** System administrators; organizational personnel responsible for managing internal connections; information system security officers.

**Test:** Internal system connection authorization mechanisms; internal connection monitoring mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- CA-09a. — Internal connections of organization-defined system components or classes of components are authorized
- CA-09b. — The security and privacy characteristics of internal connections are documented for each internal connection
