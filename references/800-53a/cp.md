# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — CP: Contingency Planning Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Contingency Planning family evaluate whether the organization develops, maintains, and tests contingency plans and strategies to ensure the availability and recovery of information systems.

---

## CP-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates contingency planning policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; contingency planning procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for contingency planning policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing contingency planning policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-01a. — A contingency planning policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- CP-01b. — Contingency planning procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- CP-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## CP-2: Contingency Plan

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, maintains, and distributes a contingency plan for the system.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; contingency plan; system security plan; business impact analysis; system recovery documentation.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for contingency planning; system administrators; contingency plan coordinators.

**Test:** Contingency plan distribution mechanisms; plan notification processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-02a.[01] — A contingency plan is developed that identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency requirements
- CP-02a.[02] — The contingency plan provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics
- CP-02a.[03] — The contingency plan addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, and assigned individuals with contact information
- CP-02a.[04] — The contingency plan addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite system disruption, compromise, or failure
- CP-02a.[05] — The contingency plan addresses eventual full system restoration without deterioration of security safeguards
- CP-02b. — The contingency plan is distributed to organization-defined key contingency personnel and organizational elements
- CP-02c. — Contingency planning activities are coordinated with incident handling activities
- CP-02d. — The contingency plan is reviewed at an organization-defined frequency
- CP-02e. — The contingency plan is updated to address changes to the organization, system, or environment
- CP-02f. — The contingency plan is communicated to organization-defined key contingency personnel and organizational elements
- CP-02g. — The contingency plan is protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification

## CP-3: Contingency Training

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization provides contingency training to system users.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; contingency training materials; training records; contingency plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities; personnel who have received contingency training.

**Test:** Contingency training mechanisms; training record management systems.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-03a. — Contingency training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities within an organization-defined time period of assuming a contingency role or responsibility
- CP-03b. — Contingency training is provided when required by system changes
- CP-03c. — Contingency training is provided at an organization-defined frequency thereafter

---

## CP-4: Contingency Plan Testing

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization tests the contingency plan at an organization-defined frequency using organization-defined tests.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; contingency plan; contingency plan test results; contingency plan test documentation; after-action reports.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for contingency plan testing; system administrators.

**Test:** Contingency plan testing mechanisms; system recovery processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-04a. — The contingency plan is tested at an organization-defined frequency using organization-defined tests to determine its effectiveness and the organization's readiness to execute the plan
- CP-04b. — The contingency plan test results are reviewed
- CP-04c. — Corrective actions are initiated, if needed

---

## CP-9: System Backup

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization conducts backups of user-level and system-level information.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; system backup procedures; system security plan; backup schedules; backup storage locations; backup logs.

**Interview:** System administrators; organizational personnel responsible for backup and recovery.

**Test:** System backup mechanisms; backup integrity verification processes; restoration capabilities.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-09a. — User-level information is backed up at an organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives
- CP-09b. — System-level information is backed up at an organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives
- CP-09c. — System documentation including security and privacy-related documentation is backed up at an organization-defined frequency
- CP-09d. — The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information is protected

---

## CP-10: System Recovery and Reconstitution

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within organization-defined time periods.

**Examine:** Contingency planning policy; contingency plan; system recovery procedures; system reconstitution procedures; system security plan; system configuration settings.

**Interview:** System administrators; organizational personnel responsible for system recovery; contingency plan coordinators.

**Test:** System recovery mechanisms; reconstitution processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- CP-10 — The system is recovered and reconstituted to a known state within organization-defined time periods consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives after a disruption, compromise, or failure
