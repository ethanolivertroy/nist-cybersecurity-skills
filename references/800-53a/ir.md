# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — IR: Incident Response Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Incident Response family evaluate whether the organization establishes and maintains an incident response capability, trains personnel, tests the capability, handles incidents, and reports incident information.

---

## IR-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates incident response policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident response procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for incident response policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing incident response policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-01a. — An incident response policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- IR-01b. — Incident response procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- IR-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## IR-2: Incident Response Training

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization provides incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident response training materials; training records; incident response plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel with incident response roles; personnel who have received incident response training.

**Test:** Incident response training mechanisms; training delivery systems.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-02a. — Incident response training is provided to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities within an organization-defined time period of assuming an incident response role
- IR-02b. — Incident response training is provided when required by system changes
- IR-02c. — Incident response training is provided at an organization-defined frequency thereafter

---

## IR-3: Incident Response Testing

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization tests the incident response capability at an organization-defined frequency.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident response testing procedures; incident response test results; incident response plan; after-action reports.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for incident response testing; incident response team members.

**Test:** Incident response testing mechanisms; tabletop exercise results; simulated incident exercises.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-03a. — The incident response capability is tested at an organization-defined frequency using organization-defined tests
- IR-03b. — Incident response test results are reviewed and documented

---

## IR-4: Incident Handling

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization implements an incident handling capability including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident response plan; incident reports; incident response records; lessons learned documentation; system security plan.

**Interview:** Incident response team members; organizational personnel responsible for incident handling; system administrators.

**Test:** Incident handling processes; automated incident handling mechanisms; evidence collection procedures.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-04a. — An incident handling capability for incidents is implemented that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery
- IR-04b. — Incident handling activities are coordinated with contingency planning activities
- IR-04c. — Lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities are incorporated into incident response procedures, training, and testing

---

## IR-5: Incident Monitoring

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization tracks and documents incidents on an ongoing basis.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident monitoring records; incident tracking system; incident reports.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for incident monitoring; incident response team members.

**Test:** Incident monitoring and tracking mechanisms; automated incident tracking tools.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-05 — Incidents are tracked and documented on an ongoing basis

---

## IR-6: Incident Reporting

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization requires personnel to report suspected incidents and reports incident information to appropriate authorities.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident reporting procedures; incident reports; reporting communications; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for incident reporting; incident response team members.

**Test:** Incident reporting mechanisms; automated reporting tools.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-06a. — Personnel are required to report suspected incidents to the organizational incident response capability within an organization-defined time period
- IR-06b. — Incident information is reported to organization-defined authorities

---

## IR-7: Incident Response Assistance

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization provides an incident response support resource.

**Examine:** Incident response policy; incident response plan; help desk procedures; incident response support resources documentation.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for incident response assistance; help desk personnel.

**Test:** Incident response support mechanisms; help desk integration with incident response capability.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-07 — An incident response support resource integral to the organizational incident response capability is provided that offers advice and assistance to users for the handling and reporting of incidents

---

## IR-8: Incident Response Plan

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops an incident response plan that provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability.

**Examine:** Incident response plan; system security plan; incident response policy; plan distribution records.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for the incident response plan; incident response team members; authorizing officials.

**Test:** Incident response plan distribution mechanisms; plan review processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- IR-08a.[01] — An incident response plan is developed that provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability
- IR-08a.[02] — The plan defines the structure and organization of the incident response capability
- IR-08a.[03] — The plan provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization
- IR-08a.[04] — The plan defines reportable incidents
- IR-08a.[05] — The plan provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability
- IR-08b. — The incident response plan is distributed to organization-defined incident response personnel and organizational elements
- IR-08c. — The incident response plan is reviewed at an organization-defined frequency
- IR-08d. — The incident response plan is updated to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing
