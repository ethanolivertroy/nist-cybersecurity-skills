## MA-6: Timely Maintenance

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization obtains maintenance support and/or spare parts for system components within an organization-defined time period of failure.

**Examine:** System maintenance policy; service-level agreements; spare parts inventory; maintenance support contracts; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for system maintenance; supply chain management personnel.

**Test:** Maintenance support response time tracking; spare parts availability verification.
