# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — MP: Media Protection Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Media Protection family evaluate whether the organization protects, controls, sanitizes, and disposes of system media containing sensitive information.

---

## MP-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates media protection policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media protection procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media protection policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing media protection policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-01a. — A media protection policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- MP-01b. — Media protection procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- MP-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## MP-2: Media Access

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization restricts access to organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media to organization-defined personnel or roles.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media access procedures; system security plan; access control records for media; media inventory.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media access control; system administrators.

**Test:** Media access control mechanisms; physical access controls for media storage areas.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-02 — Access to organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media is restricted to organization-defined personnel or roles

---

## MP-3: Media Marking

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization marks system media indicating distribution limitations, handling caveats, and applicable security markings.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media marking procedures; system security plan; marked media examples.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media marking.

**Test:** Media marking implementation verification.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-03a. — Organization-defined types of system media are marked indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats, and applicable security markings of the information
- MP-03b. — Organization-defined types of system media are exempted from marking if the media remain within organization-defined controlled areas

---

## MP-4: Media Storage

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization physically controls and securely stores system media within controlled areas.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media storage procedures; system security plan; physical access controls for media storage; media inventory.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media storage; facility security personnel.

**Test:** Physical access controls for media storage areas; media storage security mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-04a. — Organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media are physically controlled and securely stored within organization-defined controlled areas
- MP-04b. — System media are protected until destroyed or sanitized using approved methods

---

## MP-5: Media Transport

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization protects and controls system media during transport outside of controlled areas.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media transport procedures; system security plan; media transport records; encryption documentation.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media transport; information system security officers.

**Test:** Media transport protection mechanisms; cryptographic mechanisms for digital media protection during transport.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-05a. — Organization-defined types of system media are protected and controlled during transport outside of controlled areas using organization-defined controls
- MP-05b. — The activities associated with the transport of system media are documented
- MP-05c. — Personnel engaged in the transport of system media are identified
- MP-05d. — System media transport activities are restricted to authorized personnel

---

## MP-6: Media Sanitization

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization sanitizes system media prior to disposal, release, or reuse using applicable standards and policies.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media sanitization procedures; system security plan; media sanitization records; system component inventory; NIST SP 800-88 compliance documentation.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for media sanitization; system administrators.

**Test:** Media sanitization tools and mechanisms; sanitization verification processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-06a. — Organization-defined system media is sanitized using organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse
- MP-06b. — Sanitization mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information are employed

---

## MP-7: Media Use

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization restricts the use of organization-defined types of system media on organization-defined systems or system components.

**Examine:** Media protection policy; media use procedures; system security plan; system configuration settings; media use restrictions.

**Interview:** System administrators; organizational personnel responsible for media use restrictions.

**Test:** Media use restriction mechanisms; portable storage device controls.

**Determination Statements:**
- MP-07a. — The use of organization-defined types of system media is restricted or prohibited on organization-defined systems or system components using organization-defined controls
- MP-07b. — The use of portable storage devices in organizational systems is restricted or prohibited when such devices have no identifiable owner
