# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — PE: Physical and Environmental Protection Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Physical and Environmental Protection family evaluate whether the organization limits physical access to systems, protects the physical plant, and provides environmental safeguards.

## PE-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates physical and environmental protection policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; physical and environmental protection procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for physical and environmental protection policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing physical and environmental protection policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-01a. — A physical and environmental protection policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- PE-01b. — Physical and environmental protection procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- PE-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## PE-2: Physical Access Authorizations

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, approves, and maintains a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; physical access authorization records; physical access list; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for physical access authorizations; facility security personnel.

**Test:** Physical access authorization processes; credential issuance processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-02a. — A list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the system resides is developed, approved, and maintained
- PE-02b. — Authorization credentials are issued for facility access
- PE-02c. — The access list is reviewed at an organization-defined frequency, and individuals removed when access is no longer required

## PE-3: Physical Access Control

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization enforces physical access authorizations at entry and exit points.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; physical access control procedures; physical access control logs; physical access control mechanisms; facility security plans; visitor logs.

**Interview:** Facility security personnel; system administrators; organizational personnel responsible for physical access control.

**Test:** Physical access control mechanisms (card readers, biometrics, mantraps, locks); visitor escort processes; alarm systems.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-03a. — Physical access authorizations are enforced at organization-defined entry/exit points to the facility by verifying individual access authorizations before granting access
- PE-03b. — Physical access audit logs are maintained for entry/exit points
- PE-03c. — Physical access devices are controlled and managed
- PE-03d. — Visitors are escorted and visitor activity is monitored
- PE-03e. — Keys, combinations, and other physical access devices are secured
- PE-03f. — Inventories of physical access devices are maintained
- PE-03g. — Physical access devices are changed at an organization-defined frequency and/or when devices are compromised, lost, or keys are lost or combinations are compromised

## PE-4: Access Control for Transmission

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization controls physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within organizational facilities.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; system security plan; facility floor plans showing transmission lines; physical access controls for transmission media.

**Interview:** Facility security personnel; system administrators; network engineers.

**Test:** Physical access controls for wiring closets, cable trays, and transmission infrastructure.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-04 — Physical access to organization-defined system distribution and transmission lines is controlled within organizational facilities

---

## PE-5: Access Control for Output Devices

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization controls physical access to output from system output devices.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; system security plan; list of output devices; physical access controls for output devices.

**Interview:** System administrators; organizational personnel responsible for controlling output device access.

**Test:** Output device access control mechanisms; print release systems.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-05 — Physical access to output from organization-defined system output devices is controlled to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output

---

## PE-6: Monitoring Physical Access

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization monitors the facility for physical security incidents.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; physical access monitoring records; physical access logs; surveillance video recordings; alarm system records; incident reports.

**Interview:** Facility security personnel; organizational personnel responsible for physical access monitoring.

**Test:** Physical access monitoring mechanisms (video surveillance, intrusion alarms, motion detectors).

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-06a. — Physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored to detect and respond to physical security incidents
- PE-06b. — Physical access monitoring records are reviewed at an organization-defined frequency and upon occurrence of organization-defined events
- PE-06c. — Review results are coordinated with organizational incident response capability

---

## PE-8: Visitor Access Records

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization maintains visitor access records.

**Examine:** Physical and environmental protection policy; visitor access records; visitor log; system security plan.

**Interview:** Facility security personnel; organizational personnel responsible for visitor access records.

**Test:** Visitor access record management processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- PE-08a. — Visitor access records to the facility where the system resides are maintained that include the name and organization of the person visiting, the signature of the visitor, the form of identification, the date of access, the time of entry and departure, the purpose of visit, and the name and organization of the person visited
- PE-08b. — Visitor access records are reviewed at an organization-defined frequency
