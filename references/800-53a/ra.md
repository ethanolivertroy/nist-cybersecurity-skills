# NIST SP 800-53A Rev 5 — RA: Risk Assessment Assessment Procedures

Assessment procedures for the Risk Assessment family evaluate whether the organization conducts risk assessments, vulnerability scanning, and threat analysis.

---

## RA-1: Policy and Procedures

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops, documents, disseminates, reviews, and updates risk assessment policy and procedures.

**Examine:** Risk assessment policy; risk assessment procedures; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for risk assessment policy.

**Test:** Organizational processes for managing risk assessment policy.

**Determination Statements:**
- RA-01a. — A risk assessment policy is developed, documented, and disseminated
- RA-01b. — Risk assessment procedures are developed, documented, and disseminated
- RA-01c. — The policy and procedures are reviewed and updated at an organization-defined frequency

---

## RA-2: Security Categorization

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization categorizes the system and its information in accordance with applicable laws and standards.

**Examine:** Risk assessment policy; security categorization documentation; system security plan; FIPS 199 categorization.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for security categorization; system owners; information system security officers.

**Test:** Security categorization processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- RA-02a. — The system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system are categorized in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines
- RA-02b. — The security categorization results including supporting rationale are documented in the system security plan
- RA-02c. — The security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative

## RA-3: Risk Assessment

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization conducts risk assessments and documents results.

**Examine:** Risk assessment policy; risk assessment reports; risk assessment methodology; system security plan; organizational risk register.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for risk assessment; system owners; information system security officers.

**Test:** Risk assessment processes and tools; risk scoring methodologies.

**Determination Statements:**
- RA-03a. — A risk assessment is conducted to identify threats to and vulnerabilities in the system
- RA-03b. — The likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction are assessed
- RA-03c. — Risk assessment results are documented in the security and privacy plans, risk assessment reports, or organization-defined documents
- RA-03d. — Risk assessment results are reviewed by organization-defined personnel or roles
- RA-03e. — The risk assessment is updated at an organization-defined frequency or when significant changes occur to the system or environment

---

## RA-5: Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization monitors and scans for vulnerabilities in the system.

**Examine:** Risk assessment policy; vulnerability scanning procedures; vulnerability scanning results; scan tool configurations; remediation records; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for vulnerability scanning; system administrators; information system security officers.

**Test:** Vulnerability scanning tools; scanning processes; remediation verification processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- RA-05a. — The system and hosted applications are monitored and scanned for vulnerabilities at an organization-defined frequency and/or randomly and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported
- RA-05b. — Vulnerability scanning tools and techniques are employed that facilitate interoperability and automate parts of the vulnerability management process
- RA-05c. — Vulnerability scan reports and results from monitoring are analyzed
- RA-05d. — Legitimate vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk
- RA-05e. — Information obtained from vulnerability monitoring and scanning is shared with organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems
