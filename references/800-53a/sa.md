## SA-9: External System Services

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization requires external system service providers to comply with organizational security requirements.

**Examine:** System and services acquisition policy; external system service agreements; service-level agreements; system security plan; continuous monitoring records for external services.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for external service management; information system security officers; contracting officers.

**Test:** External service provider compliance monitoring mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- SA-09a. — External system service providers comply with organizational security and privacy requirements and employ organization-defined controls
- SA-09b. — Organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services are defined and documented
- SA-09c. — Processes, methods, and techniques are employed to monitor security and privacy control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis

---

## SA-10: Developer Configuration Management

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization requires the developer to perform configuration management during system development.

**Examine:** System and services acquisition policy; configuration management plans; system design documentation; change control records; system security plan.

**Interview:** System developers; organizational personnel responsible for developer oversight; configuration management personnel.

**Test:** Developer configuration management processes; change tracking mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- SA-10a. — The developer of the system, system component, or system service performs configuration management during system design, development, implementation, and operation
- SA-10b. — Changes to the system are documented, managed, and controlled
- SA-10c. — The integrity of changes is tracked
- SA-10d. — Only organization-approved changes are implemented

---

## SA-11: Developer Testing and Evaluation

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization requires the developer to create and implement a security assessment plan.

**Examine:** System and services acquisition policy; security assessment plan; developer testing results; flaw remediation records; system security plan.

**Interview:** System developers; organizational personnel responsible for developer testing oversight.

**Test:** Developer security testing processes; flaw remediation verification.

**Determination Statements:**
- SA-11a. — The developer of the system, system component, or system service creates and implements a security and privacy assessment plan at organization-defined depth of testing/evaluation
- SA-11b. — Evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation are produced
- SA-11c. — A verifiable flaw remediation process is implemented
- SA-11d. — Flaw remediation results are documented
