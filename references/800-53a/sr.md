## SR-3: Supply Chain Controls and Processes

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization establishes processes to address supply chain weaknesses and employs controls to protect against supply chain risks.

**Examine:** Supply chain risk management policy; supply chain controls documentation; system security plan; supply chain risk assessment results.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for supply chain controls; acquisition personnel; system administrators.

**Test:** Supply chain control processes; supply chain assessment mechanisms.

**Determination Statements:**
- SR-03a. — A process is established to identify and address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements and processes
- SR-03b. — Organization-defined controls are employed to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system component, or system service
- SR-03c. — The selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls are documented

## SR-5: Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization employs acquisition strategies and procurement methods to protect against supply chain risks.

**Examine:** Supply chain risk management policy; acquisition strategy documentation; contract documentation; procurement records; system security plan.

**Interview:** Acquisition personnel; contracting officers; organizational personnel responsible for supply chain risk management.

**Test:** Acquisition process verification; contract supply chain requirement verification.

**Determination Statements:**
- SR-05 — Organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods are employed to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks

---

## SR-6: Supplier Assessments and Reviews

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization assesses and reviews supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers.

**Examine:** Supply chain risk management policy; supplier assessment records; supplier risk assessment results; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for supplier assessments; acquisition personnel.

**Test:** Supplier assessment processes; risk evaluation methods.

**Determination Statements:**
- SR-06 — Supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service they provide are assessed and reviewed at an organization-defined frequency

---

## SR-8: Notification Agreements

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization establishes notification agreements with supply chain entities.

**Examine:** Supply chain risk management policy; notification agreements; contracts with supply chain notification requirements; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for supply chain management; contracting officers.

**Test:** Notification agreement processes; notification mechanism verification.

**Determination Statements:**
- SR-08 — Agreements and procedures are established with entities involved in the supply chain for the system, system component, or system service for the notification of supply chain compromises and the results of assessments or audits

---

## SR-11: Component Authenticity

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if the organization develops and implements anti-counterfeit policies and procedures.

**Examine:** Supply chain risk management policy; anti-counterfeit policies and procedures; component inspection records; counterfeit detection records; system security plan.

**Interview:** Organizational personnel responsible for component authenticity; supply chain management personnel.

**Test:** Anti-counterfeit detection mechanisms; component inspection processes.

**Determination Statements:**
- SR-11a. — Anti-counterfeit policies and procedures are developed and implemented that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the system
- SR-11b. — Counterfeit system components are reported to organization-defined external reporting organizations
- SR-11c. — Organization-defined anti-counterfeit technologies and techniques are used
