# Cross-Reference: SP 800-53 Rev 5 to SP 800-171 Rev 2/Rev 3

## Overview

SP 800-171 security requirements are **derived from the SP 800-53 Moderate baseline**. The derivation involves starting with all controls in the Moderate baseline and then removing controls that are:

1. **Uniquely federal** — controls that address the responsibility of the federal government and are not applicable to nonfederal organizations (e.g., federal-specific reporting, security authorization processes defined for federal agencies)
2. **Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI** — controls focused on availability or integrity where the primary concern is CUI confidentiality
3. **Expected to be routinely satisfied by nonfederal organizations** — controls that nonfederal organizations would satisfy as a matter of standard business practice without needing a specific security requirement (e.g., having an organizational policy)

The result is a focused set of security requirements that protect CUI in nonfederal environments.

## Key SP 800-53 Controls NOT in SP 800-171

The following significant SP 800-53 controls are excluded from SP 800-171, grouped by reason:

### Excluded as Uniquely Federal Responsibilities

| Control | Title | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **CA-2** | Control Assessments | Federal-specific assessment requirements; nonfederal organizations use SP 800-171A or CMMC |
| **CA-5** | Plan of Action and Milestones | POAM is a federal RMF artifact; nonfederal orgs may use their own tracking |
| **CA-6** | Authorization | ATO process is a federal construct; not directly applicable to nonfederal orgs |
| **CA-7** | Continuous Monitoring | Formal CM program as defined for federal agencies |
| **PM-1 through PM-32** | Program Management (entire family) | Program Management controls are organizational-level federal requirements |
| **PL-2** | System Security Plan | SSP as defined in the RMF is a federal requirement; nonfederal orgs describe their security in contracts/documentation |
| **PL-4** | Rules of Behavior | Federal-specific acceptable use requirement |
| **IR-6** | Incident Reporting | Federal-specific reporting to CISA/US-CERT (nonfederal orgs report to contracting agency per contract) |

### Excluded — Not Directly Related to CUI Confidentiality

| Control | Title | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **CP-1 through CP-13** | Contingency Planning (entire family in Rev 2) | CP family focuses on availability/continuity; 800-171 focuses on CUI confidentiality. Some availability aspects are addressed indirectly. |
| **SA-1 through SA-23** | System and Services Acquisition (most controls in Rev 2) | SA family focuses on system development lifecycle; some acquisition controls are addressed through other means |
| **PE-9** | Power Equipment and Cabling | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-10** | Emergency Shutoff | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-11** | Emergency Power | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-12** | Emergency Lighting | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-13** | Fire Protection | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-14** | Environmental Controls (Temperature/Humidity) | Environmental/availability control |
| **PE-15** | Water Damage Protection | Environmental/availability control |

### Excluded — Expected to Be Routinely Satisfied

| Control | Title | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| **XX-1** | Policy and Procedures (all families) | Nonfederal organizations are expected to have policies and procedures as standard business practice; 800-171 does not require specific policy documents per family |
| **AC-22** | Publicly Accessible Content | Nonfederal organizations manage their public content through standard practices |
| **AT-1** | Policy and Procedures (AT) | Expected to exist; not a separate requirement |
| **PS-1** | Policy and Procedures (PS) | Expected to exist; not a separate requirement |

### Excluded — Addressed Differently

| Control | Title | How Addressed in 800-171 |
|---------|-------|-------------------------|
| **AC-2** | Account Management | Partially addressed; some aspects are covered but not all AC-2 enhancements |
| **AU-1** | Policy and Procedures (AU) | Audit requirements are addressed without a separate policy control |
| **SC-1** | Policy and Procedures (SC) | Communications protection requirements are addressed directly |

## Derivation Process in Detail

```
SP 800-53 Rev 5 Moderate Baseline (~325 controls with enhancements)
    |
    |-- Remove: Federal-specific controls (CA-6, PM family, PL-2, etc.)
    |-- Remove: Availability-focused controls (CP family, PE environmental)
    |-- Remove: Policy & procedure controls (XX-1 for all families)
    |-- Remove: Controls routinely satisfied by nonfederal orgs
    |-- Tailor: Restate remaining controls as "security requirements"
    |
    v
SP 800-171 Rev 2 (~110 security requirements)
SP 800-171 Rev 3 (reorganized with direct 800-53 traceability)
```

## CUI Overlay Concept

SP 800-171 can be thought of as a **CUI confidentiality overlay** applied to the SP 800-53 Moderate baseline:

- **Overlay purpose:** Protect the confidentiality of CUI
- **Baseline source:** SP 800-53 Moderate
- **Tailoring actions:** Remove non-applicable controls, adjust for nonfederal context
- **Result:** A focused set of requirements appropriate for nonfederal organizations

Organizations that need to protect CUI integrity or availability in addition to confidentiality should consider implementing controls from SP 800-53 beyond those in SP 800-171.

## NFO Controls — Nonfederal Organization Controls

SP 800-171 Rev 2 included a set of **NFO (Nonfederal Organization) controls** in Appendix E — these are SP 800-53 controls that were removed from 800-171 but that nonfederal organizations are expected to implement as part of standard business practices. They are considered "basic safeguarding requirements" and include:

- Having security policies
- Conducting security awareness activities
- Managing system configurations
- Performing security assessments
- Other fundamental practices

These NFO controls represent the baseline expectation — 800-171 requirements are **in addition to** these basic practices.
