# Cross-Reference: SP 800-53 Rev 5 Control Families to NIST CSF 2.0 Functions and Categories

## Overview

NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls, while the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides a high-level, outcome-based framework organized into six Functions. This document maps the 20 SP 800-53 control families to the CSF 2.0 Functions and identifies specific controls that implement key CSF Categories.

CSF 2.0 is designed to be technology- and vendor-neutral, expressing desired outcomes. SP 800-53 provides the specific, implementable controls that achieve those outcomes. Many controls map to multiple CSF Functions since a single control can serve multiple purposes.

## CSF 2.0 Functions

| Function | Code | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Govern** | GV | Establish and monitor cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy |
| **Identify** | ID | Understand the organization's cybersecurity risk posture |
| **Protect** | PR | Safeguard assets to prevent or reduce cybersecurity risk |
| **Detect** | DE | Find and analyze possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises |
| **Respond** | RS | Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident |
| **Recover** | RC | Restore assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident |

## Notes on the Mapping

1. **Many-to-many relationship:** Most SP 800-53 controls map to multiple CSF Categories, and each CSF Category is implemented by multiple controls. This mapping shows the strongest/primary relationships.

2. **CSF 2.0 Govern function:** The Govern function is new in CSF 2.0. It is primarily implemented by the PM, PL, and SR families, plus the "-1" (Policy and Procedures) controls from every family.

3. **Control enhancements:** The mappings above reference base controls. Many control enhancements provide more specific mappings to CSF subcategories. For example, AC-2(1) through AC-2(13) provide progressively stronger implementations relevant to PR.AA.

4. **NIST provides official mappings:** NIST maintains official informative references between SP 800-53 and CSF at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt — the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT) provides authoritative cross-references.
