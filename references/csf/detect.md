# NIST CSF 2.0 — Detect (DE) Function

## Overview

The **Detect (DE)** Function enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse cybersecurity events that may indicate that the organization's assets have been compromised.

Detection is critical because the faster an organization identifies an attack or compromise, the more effectively it can contain and respond to the incident, reducing potential harm. The Detect Function covers continuous monitoring of assets and networks as well as analysis of anomalous activity.

## Categories and Subcategories

### DE.CM — Continuous Monitoring

Assets are monitored to find anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **DE.CM-01** | Networks and network services are monitored to find potentially adverse events. |
| **DE.CM-02** | The physical environment is monitored to find potentially adverse events. |
| **DE.CM-03** | Personnel activity and technology usage are monitored to find potentially adverse events. |
| **DE.CM-06** | External service provider activities and services are monitored to find potentially adverse events. |
| **DE.CM-09** | Computing hardware and software, runtime environments, and their data are monitored to find potentially adverse events. |

### DE.AE — Adverse Event Analysis

Anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **DE.AE-02** | Potentially adverse events are analyzed to better understand associated activities. |
| **DE.AE-03** | Information is correlated from multiple sources. |
| **DE.AE-04** | The estimated impact and scope of adverse events are understood. |
| **DE.AE-06** | Information on adverse events is provided to authorized staff and tools. |
| **DE.AE-07** | Cyber threat intelligence and other contextual information are integrated into the analysis. |
| **DE.AE-08** | Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria. |
