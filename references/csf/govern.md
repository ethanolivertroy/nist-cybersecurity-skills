# NIST CSF 2.0 — Govern (GV) Function

## Overview

The **Govern (GV)** Function establishes and monitors the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy. It is **new in CSF 2.0** and is designed to be cross-cutting — the outcomes of the Govern Function inform and are implemented across the other five Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

Govern addresses the people, processes, and technology needed for cybersecurity governance, including organizational context, risk strategy, roles and responsibilities, policies, oversight, and supply chain risk management.
