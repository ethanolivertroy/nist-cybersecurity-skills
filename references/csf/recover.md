# NIST CSF 2.0 — Recover (RC) Function

## Overview

The **Recover (RC)** Function supports the timely restoration of assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident. Recovery activities ensure that the organization can return to normal operations as quickly as possible while also communicating restoration progress to relevant stakeholders.

The Recover Function works in concert with Respond (RS) — once an incident has been contained and eradicated, recovery activities restore affected systems and services to their intended operational state. Lessons learned during recovery feed back into the Govern and Identify Functions to improve future resilience.

## Categories and Subcategories

### RC.RP — Incident Recovery Plan Execution

Restoration activities are performed to ensure operational availability of systems and services affected by cybersecurity incidents.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RC.RP-01** | The recovery portion of the incident response plan is executed once initiated from the incident response process. |
| **RC.RP-02** | Recovery actions are selected, scoped, prioritized, and performed. |
| **RC.RP-03** | The integrity of backups and other restoration assets is verified before using them for restoration. |
| **RC.RP-04** | Critical mission functions and cybersecurity risk management are considered to establish post-incident operational norms. |
| **RC.RP-05** | The integrity of restored assets is verified, systems and services are restored, and normal operating status is confirmed. |
| **RC.RP-06** | The end of incident recovery is declared based on criteria, and incident-related documentation is completed. |

Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RC.CO-03** | Recovery activities and progress in restoring operational capabilities are communicated to designated internal and external stakeholders. |
| **RC.CO-04** | Public updates on incident recovery are shared using approved methods and messaging. |
