# NIST CSF 2.0 — Respond (RS) Function

## Overview

The **Respond (RS)** Function supports the ability to take action once a cybersecurity incident has been detected and declared. The goal is to contain the impact of the incident and move toward resolution. Response activities include incident management, analysis, reporting and communication, and mitigation.

Effective incident response requires coordination across the organization, with external stakeholders (e.g., law enforcement, regulators, ISACs), and with suppliers and partners.

## Categories and Subcategories

### RS.MA — Incident Management

Responses to detected cybersecurity incidents are managed.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RS.MA-01** | The incident response plan is executed in coordination with relevant third parties once an incident is declared. |
| **RS.MA-02** | Incident reports are triaged and validated. |
| **RS.MA-03** | Incidents are categorized and prioritized. |
| **RS.MA-04** | Incidents are escalated or elevated as needed. |
| **RS.MA-05** | The criteria for initiating incident recovery are applied. |

### RS.AN — Incident Analysis

Investigations are conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RS.AN-03** | Analysis is performed to determine what has taken place during an incident and the root cause of the incident. |
| **RS.AN-06** | Actions performed during an investigation are recorded, and the records' integrity and provenance are preserved. |
| **RS.AN-07** | Incident data and metadata are collected, and their integrity and provenance are preserved. |
| **RS.AN-08** | An incident's magnitude is estimated and validated. |

### RS.CO — Incident Response Reporting and Communication

Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders as required by laws, regulations, or policies.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RS.CO-02** | Internal and external stakeholders are notified of incidents. |
| **RS.CO-03** | Information is shared with designated internal and external stakeholders. |
| **RS.CO-04** | Incident information is shared with applicable law enforcement and other authorities as appropriate. |

### RS.MI — Incident Mitigation

Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and mitigate its effects.

| Subcategory | Description |
|---|---|
| **RS.MI-01** | Incidents are contained. |
| **RS.MI-02** | Incidents are eradicated. |
